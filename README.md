# Pokemon Dataset

This repository consist of Python Notebook where I implemented Data Extraction and perform tasks like Feature Engineering,Data Cleaning and formed a comprehensive dataset.
The following Dataset contains 


| Column            | Description                                                                              |

| `Base_Experience` | Base experience points gained when defeated                                              |
| `Height`          | Height of the Pokémon (decimetres)                                                       |
| `Weight`          | Weight of the Pokémon (hectograms)                                                       |
| `Stats`           | Base stats for the Pokémon (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed) |
| `Types`           | Primary and secondary types (`Type_1`, `Type_2`)                                         |
| `Egg_Groups`      | Egg groups for breeding                                                                  |
| `Species`         | Pokémon species classification                                                           |
| `Capture_Rate`    | Likelihood of catching the Pokémon                                                       |
| `Base_Happiness`  | Base happiness level                                                                     |

[#Pokemon_Dataset_Extraction.ipynb] - The whole procedure is implemented in this Python Notebook.
[#pokemon_dataset.csv] -> This is output/dataset obtained after extraction and cleaning.

##Usage

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Pokémon type and stat comparison

- Game strategy analysis

## Note
This dataset was extracted from PokéAPI and cleaned for analysis purposes. PokéAPI is an educational API and all credit goes to them for providing the data.
